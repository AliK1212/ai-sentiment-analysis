## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the service:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

## Model Weights

The ensemble approach uses the following weights for combining predictions:
- DistilBERT: 30%
- RoBERTa: 30%
- VADER: 20%
- TextBlob: 20%

This combination provides optimal accuracy across different types of text:
- Formal writing
- Social media content
- Customer reviews
- News articles
- Casual conversations

## Example Use Cases

1. **Customer Feedback Analysis**:
```json
{
  "text": "The new feature is amazing! Much better than before.",
  "include_confidence_scores": true
}
```

2. **Social Media Monitoring**:
```json
{
  "texts": [
    "Love the new features! #greatapp üòç",
    "This update is terrible, nothing works anymore üò°",
    "Interesting changes, need time to get used to them ü§î"
  ]
}
```

3. **Business Reviews**:
```json
{
  "text": "Great service but slightly expensive. Staff was very friendly.",
  "include_confidence_scores": true
}
```

## Performance

The ensemble approach significantly improves accuracy compared to single-model solutions:
- Better handling of mixed sentiments
- More accurate neutral sentiment detection
- Improved understanding of context and nuance
- Enhanced handling of informal text and emoticons
